# Patrick Morris

ðŸ‘‹, I'm Patrick. I'm a new dad, runner, and data guy. I've spent the past decade working at media companies helping them transition to a digital subscription model. I currently manage an analytics team for Disney Streaming, focusing on ESPN+.

Before Disney, I worked at The New York Times where I held a variety of roles as a developer, data analysts, and product manager. I started at The TImes as a developer working on the paywall, then transitioned to the data team analyzing hundreds of experiments, and finished my tenure building and managing our in house experimentation platform.

Outside of work, I run with [Brooklyn Track Club](https://www.instagram.com/brooklyntrackclub/) and spend as much time as possible with my son.
